# Text-Based-Adventure-Game
To whoever is reading this, my name is Trevor Anderson and I am an aspiring software developer at the University of Connecticut. I am a freshman this year, hoping to get more experience with different types of SWE, different languages, and more. This was my first ever passion project I did in Python. In it, you can choose which "path" you want to go down, and depending on which path you say you want to go down will determine your fate in the game. Everyone starts with 10 health points, and every time you choose a bad path, something happens to you and you lose health. If your health gets to 0 you lose and start from the beginning, otherwise if you survive...you survive! As I learn more about the syntax and the concepts, I will revise the code in this program to make it more understandable and readable. Hope you enjoy this simple yet exciting game!
